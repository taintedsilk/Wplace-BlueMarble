<h2>Fork Info</h2>
A vibe coded fork of Blue Marble that adds the missing feature to SEMI-automatically paint

How to use:

Enable Quick Paint, enter amount of pixels to reserve

When you paint any pixel, it will prevent the pixel from being painted and instead paint the pixels that are incorrect in the template

Extension will automatically detect the colors you have and current paint charge remaining (the current page charge will update after you reload the page after quick painting)

Installation: Copy the compiled user.js in /dist to tampermonkey
